# Non-Carbon-Based-Life-Simulation
a simple model to represent a hypothetical silicon-based organism that utilizes silicon compounds: This model will demonstrate cellular growth, metabolic rates, and interactions with an environment. We might imagine that this silicon-based life form draws energy from silicon disulfide and metabolizes silicon oxides.
